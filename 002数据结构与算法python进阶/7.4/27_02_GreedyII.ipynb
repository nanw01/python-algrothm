Notice that sum of the coefficients are always constant, hence we want to find a distribution of ai obtainable such that S is minimum. To do so we perform cuts on highest cost edge as early as possible, which will reach to optimal S. If we encounter several edges having the same cost, we can cut any one of them first.\n",

If still we are left with k > 0 then we apply the same procedure from the very next starting position i.e., a2, a3,…(ak or an) and then place it to the a1 position.
