    "The basic idea is to put every rabbit with the same key (answer) into the same group as much as possible. This fails when key+1 (count itself) is smaller than the cnt (please look at the code). That means we have to divide this group into subgroups to hold this cnt. The number of the subgroup is computed from ceil(1.0 x cnt/key), so the total number of all these subgroups under the same key is ceil(1.0 * cnt/key) * key."
