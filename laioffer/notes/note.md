### what is machine learning?

Machine Learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things-numbers, words, clicks, images, what have you. If it is can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine learning algorithm.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that gives systems the ability to learn and optimize processes without having to be consistently programmed. Simply put, machine learning uses data, statistics, and trial and error to “learn” a specific task without ever having to be specifically coded for the task.

### what is big data?


### what is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

### what is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called Artificial Neural Network(ANN)


### Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

Machine Learning has a simpler structure; Deep Learning has a complex structure
Deep Learning requires less human intervention
Deep Learning has hierarchical feature extraction, and suitable for extracting complex features from data.
