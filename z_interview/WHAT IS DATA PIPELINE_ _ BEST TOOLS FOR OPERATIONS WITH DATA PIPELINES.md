what is meant by a data pipeline well
it is a series of tools and actions for organizing and transferring the data to different storage and analysis systems
it automates the etl process extraction transformation load as a data pipeline

example

you can collect information about your

customers devices

location and session duration and track

their purchases

and interaction with your brand's

customer service

and how does a data pipeline work the

raw unstructured data is located at the

beginning of the pipeline

then it passes a series of steps and

each of them transforms the data

watch further to review these steps in

more detail

step one is collecting the data at this

stage

the system gathers the data from

thousands of sources

such as databases apis cloud sources

and social media step two is extraction

after the raw data is collected the

system starts reading each piece of data

using the data sources api

and after the data is extracted it goes

through processing

if the sets of records are extracted and

counted as one group

batch processing is applied real-time

processing passes individual records as

soon as they are created or recognized

well by default the companies use batch

processing

since it is easier and cheaper step 3 is

transformation and standardization now

you need to adjust the structure or

format of the data

among the most common types of

transformation are basic transformations

in which only the appearance and format

of the data is affected

without severe content changes and

advanced transformations

in which the content and the

relationship between data sets are

changed

step 4 is destination and this is the

final point where the clean data is

transferred

further they can go to data warehouses

while less structured data is stored in

data lakes

step five is monitoring to ensure that

the data is accurate

the engineers continuously check the

pipeline data by monitoring

logging and alerting the code and what

do you think

which of these transforming data steps

is considered the most important one

drop a comment you might have heard of

aws data pipeline

what is it aws data pipeline is a web

service allowing data processing

and moving it between different

computing services aws storage

and local data sources it helps to

easily create complex data processing

pipeline operations

and guarantee their fault tolerance and

high availability

by the way check out the full guide to

aws monitoring we have prepared

the link is in the description data

pipeline is widely

used for machine learning the pipelines

are used to automate the training

workflow

and to prepare the data for training we

are excited to share jelvix's six simple

steps of how to build a data pipeline in

machine learning

so step one is data collection step two

is data preparation

step three is splitting the data into

test set

training set and validation set step

four is training the model

step five is testing and validating the

model and step six

is deployment and then you iterate

let's now review the list of tools for

building ml pipelines

we use google ml kit deploy the models

in the mobile application via api

amazon sagemaker an mlass platform for

conducting the full cycle of preparing

training and deploying a model

tensorflow

an open source machine learning

framework developed by google

with robust integration with keras api

for general operations with data

pipelines we at javix use the following

tools

for etl data preparation and data

integration tools

we use aws glue informatica power center

apache spark tail end open studio

data warehouse tools to use are amazon

redshift

snowflake oracle data lakes tools are

offered by such providers as microsoft

azure

ibm and aws batch schedulers we

recommend

are airflow luigi uzi or azkaban

and finally stream processing tools we

use are apache spark

flink storm kafka and amazon kinesis

these tools to be reviewed on our
